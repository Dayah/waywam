<h1>Why are you wearing a mask?</h1>
<p>Short answer: it's a nearly effortless way of minimizing the risk of illness.</p>

<section>
<h2>But getting sick is a normal part of life</h2>
<p>It doesn't have to be. Many times in history disease has wiped out several percent of the population. Now that we know it's spread through infectious aerosols and those can be blocked with 50¢ of fabric, why not avoid illness altogether?</p>

<h2>There's worse things than getting a sniffle</h2>
<p>Despite everyone claiming they "never get sick," the average person falls ill 2-4 times a year. A common cold lasts a week, while the flu or RSV can be a multi-week recovery, several days of which are quite miserable. That's about 10% of each year spent below baseline—time lost to illness. You can have that time back by covering your face in a few high-risk situations.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If someone offered you a billion dollars with the only catch being that you’d have a pretty bad cold for the rest of your life, would you take it?<br><br>Definite no for me and, I’d guess, for many of you. Really highlights how much more important health is than everything else.</p>&mdash; Tim Urban (@waitbutwhy) <a href="https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/1702838925067260051?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>If your life difficulties are so great that years completely free of fever, stuffy nose, and miserable Nyquil nights doesn't appeal to you, this probably isn't for you and you can stop reading.</p>

<h2>Wearing a mask shows cowardice</h2>
<p>If your profession requires you to project fearlessness like car sales or bar bouncer, the tradeoff of a few weeks of health may not be worth the downside of being perceived as weak. Nor may it be if you are concerned about fitting in or fearful of potential conflict. That's your choice to make, and if your status or livelihood is in a position to be threatened by those above you against masks, you may decide against it.</p>

<h2>It's harder to breathe</h2>
<p>A properly fitted <a href="https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/v101143973/">3M 1870+ with waterproof membrane</a> takes some getting used to, but the <a href="https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/b00051022/">9205+</a> is just as effective. If masks <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-99100-7">significantly prevented airflow or promoted dangerous ratios of room air gases</a>, surgeons who wore them for 12-hour operations would've sought exemptions decades ago. If your diaphragm is too weak for the extra effort, the breathing difficulties from COVID will be an unpleasant surprise.</p>

<h2>So it's not about COVID?</h2>
<p>COVID made it socially acceptable <a href="https://time.com/5799964/coronavirus-face-mask-asia-us/">to do in the USA what other societies have done for years</a>. While losing weeks a year to minor illness is an unpleasantness worth avoiding on its own, COVID shifted the calculus significantly by being much more <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-023-02018-x">contagious</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html">chronic</a>, and <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/covid-omicron-variant-infection-deadlier-flu-studies-suggest">deadly</a> than other respiratory diseases. <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/large-study-provides-scientists-deeper-insight-into-long-covid-symptoms">One in 10 infections lingers for months</a>.</p>

<h2>COVID is only dangerous for old people</h2>
<p>If COVID was only its symptoms, it wouldn't be that bad for most. However, even <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04569-5">minor, asymptomatic bouts are known with certainty to reduce brain volume</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.7150/ijms.73134">dysregulate T cells in the same way as AIDS</a>. Infections may permanently deplete young people's resilience in the same way as the elderly and it goes unnoticed because of their reserves, only to reappear later in life. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mis/mis-c.html">MIS-C</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.21231">children being 30% more likely to become type 1 diabetic after COVID</a> both hint at this possibility.</p>
<p>There is no rule that the damage done by an illness must be proportional to the symptoms felt. Nor is it an immutable law of nature that more contagious diseases are less deadly. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_virulence">happens over time with evolution</a>, and COVID is brand new, however you believe it came about.</p>

<h2>Don't you trust the vaccine?</h2>
<p>Sure, when the circulating strains match the one targeted by the vaccine, I don't bother with masks. Sadly, we don't seem to get more than a few months with how rapidly it evolves.</p>

<h2>I prefer natural immunity</h2>
<p>Generations, including our own, skip over natural immunity for many diseases in favor of vaccines, from smallpox to measles, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2022.23241">attempts to retry exposure often go poorly</a>. COVID is probably in the category of diseases to avoid, rather than catch <a href="https://xkcd.com/2557/">hoping to gain more in immunity against yet another future infection</a> than you lose in long-term effects.</p>

<h2>But masks don't work</h2>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub6">At a population level, there is a lot of uncertainty</a>. But for individuals who properly use them, they do block viruses or the surgical theater and ICU would be a much deadlier place for both patients and healthcare workers.</p>

<h2>I'm not going to live in fear</h2>
<p>Life is about managing risk, not avoiding it. A mask is like a seatbelt. Go out, drive, live your life, but use available safety equipment to make it significantly less risky. No one would say they're living in fear of a car crash because they always put on a seatbelt.</p>

<h2>You don't use it all the time?</h2>
<p>Only in high traffic, enclosed airflow situations. Walking by hundreds of people in the mall or grocery store? Sure. Sitting at a coffee shop alone or spending time with a couple of people? Likely not. Wearing one for the short durations you're in very busy, poorly ventilated public places can cut down 90% of your exposure.</p>
