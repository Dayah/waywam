<h1>Why are you wearing a mask?</h1>
<p>Short answer: it's a nearly effortless way of minimizing the risk of illness.</p>

<section>
<h2>Getting sick is a normal part of life</h2>
<p>It doesn't have to be. Many times in history disease has wiped out several percent of the world. Now that we know it's spread through infectious aerosols and those can be blocked with 50¢ of fabric, why not avoid it?</p>

<h2>There's worse things than getting a sniffle</h2>
<p>The average person gets sick 2-4 times a year. A common cold lasts a week, while the flu or RSV can be a multi-week recovery, several days of which are quite miserable. That's about 10% of each year spent below baseline—time lost to illness. You can have that time back by covering your mouth in a few high-risk situations.</p>
<p>If your life difficulties are so great that a year completely free of fever, stuffy nose, and miserable Nyquil nights doesn't appeal to you, this probably isn't for you and you can stop reading.</p>

<h2>Wearing a mask shows cowardice</h2>
<p>If your profession requires you to project fearlessness or strength like car sales or bar bouncer, the tradeoff of a few weeks of health may not be worth the downside of being perceived as weak. Nor may it be if you are concerned about fitting in or fearful of potential conflict. That's your choice to make, and if your status or livelihood is in a position to be threatened by those above you against masks, you may decide against it.</p>

<h2>It's harder to breathe</h2>
<p>A properly-fitted <a href="https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/v101143973/">3M 1870+ with waterproof membrane</a> takes some getting used to, but the <a href="https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/b00051022/">9205+</a> is just as effective with much less effort. If masks <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-99100-7">significantly prevented airflow or promoted dangerous ratios of room air gasses</a>, surgeons and ICU staff would've sought out exemptions to continue their work decades ago. If your diaphragm is too weak for the extra effort, the breathing difficulties from COVID will be an unpleasant surprise.</p>

<h2>So it's not about COVID?</h2>
<p>COVID made it socially acceptable <a href="https://time.com/5799964/coronavirus-face-mask-asia-us/">to do in the USA what other societies have been doing for years</a>. It shifted the calculus significantly by being much more <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-023-02018-x">contagious</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html">chronic</a>, and <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/covid-omicron-variant-infection-deadlier-flu-studies-suggest">deadly</a> than other respiratory diseases. <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/large-study-provides-scientists-deeper-insight-into-long-covid-symptoms">One in 10 infections lingers for months</a>, and even <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35255491/">minor, asymptomatic bouts are known with certainty to reduce brain volume</a>.</p>

<h2>COVID is only dangerous for old people</h2>
<p>It could be that infections permanently deplete young people's resilience in the same way as the elderly, only it goes unnoticed because of their reserves, only to reappear later in life. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mis/mis-c.html">MIS-C</a> and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.21231">children being 30% more likely to become type 1 diabetic after COVID</a> both hint that this is the case.</p>

<h2>But masks don't work</h2>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub6">At a population level, there is a lot of uncertainty</a>. But for individuals, they do block viruses or the surgical theater and ICU would be a much deadlier place for both patients and healthcare workers.</p>

<h2>I'm not going to live in fear</h2>
<p>Life is about managing risk, not avoiding it. A mask is like a seatbelt. Go out, drive, live your life, but use available safety equipment to make it significantly less risky. No one would say they're "living in fear" of a car crash because they always put on their seatbelt.</p>

<h2>You don't use it all the time?</h2>
<p>Only in high traffic, enclosed airflow situations. Walking by hundreds of people in the mall or grocery store? Sure. Sitting at a coffee shop alone or spending time with a couple of people? Likely not. Wearing one for the short durations you're in very busy, poorly ventilated public places can cut down 90% of your exposure.</p>
